 # Design Choices

I designed the database to follow normalization and ensure data integrity:

Users table stores basic user information. Each user has a unique ID and email.

Events table stores details about events. Each event is linked to the user who created it (created_by).

RSVPs table connects users and events with a status (Yes/No/Maybe). The (user_id, event_id) pair is unique, ensuring each user can RSVP only once per event.

I also set foreign key constraints with ON DELETE CASCADE, so if a user or event is deleted, their RSVPs are automatically removed, keeping data consistent.
